          <h2>Inspiration & Drivers</h2>
          <p>OStrich is inspired by emerging AI-driven resource management, adaptive interfaces, and robust self-healing systems.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our project, Ostrich, is an AI powered next generation operating system inspired by the ostrich, the largest and one of the smartest birds. We chose this name because, like the ostrich, our system is built to be smart, adaptable, and resilient. The idea came from noticing how most operating systems today feel too heavy, rigid, or disconnected from the user's actual needs. With Ostrich, we wanted to change that by creating something that grows and learns with its users, a lighter, more intelligent OS that understands habits, adapts to environments, and keeps everything running smoothly without getting in the way.</li>
